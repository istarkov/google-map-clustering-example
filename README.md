### [Kotatsu](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/kotatsu)

I was heavily inspired of [kotatsu](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/kotatsu) project. 

This project uses `kotatsu` as run engine.

To run this project locally (with hot reload and other fine kotatsu things)

```bash
npm install
npm run start
# open your browser at localhost:4000
```

To build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### [MapBox](https://github.com/mapbox) and [Mourner](https://github.com/mourner)

Any map-geo library you want, always can be found there.

This project also uses [MapBox library written by Mourner](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster)


### [Recompose by @acdlite](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose)

My lovest library, [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) is heavily used in this project.
